# Diabetes-prediction
In this project, we used several machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, and blood pressure. The models include Random Forest Classifier, which combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy; K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which classifies based on similarity to nearby data points; AdaBoost Classifier, an ensemble method that focuses on correcting previous errors; Decision Tree Classifier, which builds a simple flowchart-like structure for decision-making; and Linear Regression, used here for analyzing feature influence despite being a regression method. These algorithms were evaluated to determine the most effective approach for accurate and reliable diabetes prediction
